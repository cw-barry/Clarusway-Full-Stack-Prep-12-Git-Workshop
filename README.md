# Git-CC-001 : Git Operations

Purpose of the this coding challenge is to learn git basics operations.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this coding challenge, students will be able to;

- clone a repositoriy from GitHub

- make basic Git operations in local repository

- send the changes to remote repository


## Preparation

If you have not already done so, set up a GitHub account and send me (tyler@clarusway.com) an email message telling me about the account.

## Problem Statement

1. Clone the repository at https://github.com/TylerCounter/project-xv

2. Add a file that describes you and named your_number_name.txt to the **participants** directory.

3. First, stage the changes.

4. then comit your changes. Use a meaningful message like "Added information about YOUR NAME HERE."

5. Use **git push** to send your change to the Tyler's remote repository. (https://github.com/TylerCounter/project-xv)

6. Look online to see if your change has been pushed.

7. Wait until some other students have pushed their update. Then use **git pull** to get their change into your repository. Verify that you have the new file.

8. Use **git log** or **git log | less** to see a list of changes to the repository.

9. Edit the file participants.md to add your name. Then add the file, commit it, and push it.

10. Whoever tries to push the file first will likely succeed. Whoever tries to push the file second will likely get an error message. Figure out how to resolve the error message.

11. Submit your commands you have run for completing the assignment?
(Tips: `$ history`)
